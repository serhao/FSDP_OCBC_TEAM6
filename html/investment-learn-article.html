                When it comes to securing your financial future, just saving stone may not be enough. In fact, starting to invest money investing is important and how you can get started with as little as S$$100 a month.

                Part 1: Stretching your dollar – why you should invest
            </p>

            <blockquote class="key-quote">
            “To thine own self be true”, Hamlet, by William Shakespeare
            <br>
            Many of us look forward to when we can stop working and quit our day jobs and still be able to afford a comfortable life after that. 
            <br>
            But before we start dreaming, let’s consider some cold, hard facts.
            <br>
            The cost of living is on the rise and no one knows better than us on where and what it costs. But whether it’s an occasional restaurant meal, commuting via taxis now and then or as little as a quick getaway – the cost of enjoying life will definitely increase over a such period of two or three decades.
            <br>
            Use our online <a href="#">OCBC Life Goals Retirement Calculator</a> to determine your number for your desired retirement.
            <br>
            Someone who is 25 years old today and wishes to retire at age 60 with the above lifestyle, can expect to need as much money for the next 30 to 40 years! This amount will also need to take into account inflation and depreciation of asset values of your payments and living expenses.
            <br>
            While it can be a pleasant prospect of having to pay off huge bills at the end of each month and not worry about money, a lot of us end up living to the grindstone for a monthy pay cheque that we hope to stretch as much as possible.
            <br>
            Another crucial realization is that it will be a big challenge saving your way to riches over the longer term.
            <br>
            The only way to grow your wealth is by investing.
            <br>
            By channeling your monthly pay into assets like unit trusts, stocks and bonds will have you realise your financial goals sooner as the expectation is that the value of these assets will also appreciate for new over time than your savings account (Figure 1).
